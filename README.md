#ShameButton
The button to push when there is simply too much shame for words. The Cersei client that responds to the button can be found [here](https://github.com/bkvarda/cersei)

###Installation
You'll need a [Photon](www.particle.io) and a breadboard, as well as some other components (like a button/switch). The physical installation is basic b as heck, and obviously yours will look better than how mine was set up:

Once the physical layout is complete, copy the source and load it onto your Photon using the [Photon IDE](http://build.particle.io). Push the button and it will send an event to the Particle cloud.  

###Usage
The ShameButton is a button that is pressed under dire, incredibly shameful circumstances. It sends events to the Particle cloud once pressed. Any device running the [Cersei](https://github.com/bkvarda/cersei) client will then play a shame clip from the GoT season 5 finale. Install it onto everyone's laptop in a conference room or office,  push the button, and watch hilarity ensue as everyone is brought down to the lowest levels of shame imaginable.
